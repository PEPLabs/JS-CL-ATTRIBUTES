  <h1>Setting Attributes</h1>

  <p>Recall that elements in the DOM are described in HTML with tags. Tags can have attributes which control various
    aspects of the element. You can add styling with the "style" attribute, you can add a destination to an anchor
    (link) tag with the "href" attribute, you can add a reference to an image element with the "src" attribute. In this
    exercise you will need to display an image by altering an image element's attributes.

  </p>

  <p>TODO: Add the code necessary to the "setImageSrc()" function found in the SettingAttributes.js file in order to
    display an image. Once complete, you should be able to enter any valid image URL into the text box below, click the
    button, and see that image rendered in the page.
  </p>

  <!-- Image element that starts with a placeholder image -->
  <img id="image" src="./resources/placeholder.png">
  <br>

  <!-- A very wide input box to accommodate long links -->
  <input style="min-width:800px" type="text" id="input">
  <br>

  <!-- This button will call the setImageSrc() function -->
  <button id="button">Update</button>

  <p>You can use any valid URL of an image for this. There are two packaged with this exercise:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>./resources/python.png</li>
    <li>./resources/java.png</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- TODO: check out the linked JS file to complete the lab; linking a JavaScript file via a script tag allows your JS
  functionality to trigger in this HTML file despite being written in a separate file. -->
  <script src="script.js"></script>


  <!-- OPTIONAL PRACTICE: If you want more practice later, try adding some text in a p tag and a button tag.
    Then try creating functionality for that button to turn the text orange by changing the class attribute
    to "orange-text". Notice that in the styling.css file there is already a CSS rule for a class named "orange-text".-->
