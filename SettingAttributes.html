  <h1>Setting Attributes</h1>

  <p>You are already aware that JavaScript can be used to alter the InnerText of an element. Here we can demonstrate
    that JavaScript can also be used to modify the attributes of an element - for instance, the image URL used in
    an image element. This exercise also demonstrates the use of external JS files as well as an external stylesheet
    for the first time.</p>

  <p>TODO: Your goal will be to write the code in the linked JS file that will change the following image to display whatever
    image URL is provided in the text input.</p>

  <!-- image element that starts off with a non-image as its 'src' value (this will result in a broken image at the start)  -->
  <img id="image" src="placeholder">
  <br>

  <!-- a very wide input box to accommodate long links -->
  <input style="min-width:800px" type="text" id="input">
  <br>

  <button id="button">update the image</button>

  <p>some example urls to use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>https://ia801201.us.archive.org/14/items/Chrysanthemum_20160913/Chrysanthemum.jpg</li>
    <li>https://ia601201.us.archive.org/14/items/Chrysanthemum_20160913/Hydrangeas.jpg</li>
    <li>https://ia801201.us.archive.org/14/items/Chrysanthemum_20160913/Tulips.jpg</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- TODO: check out the linked JS file to complete the lab; linking a JavaScript file via a script tag allows your JS
  functionality to trigger in this HTML file despite being written in a separate file. -->
  <script src="SettingAttributes.js"></script>


  <!-- OPTIONAL PRACTICE: If you want more practice later, try adding some text in a p tag and a button tag.
    Then try creating functionality for that button to turn the text orange by changing the class attribute
    to "orange-text". Notice that in the styling.css file there is already a CSS rule for a class named "orange-text".-->
